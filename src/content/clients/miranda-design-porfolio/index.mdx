I built this site with Astro for a UX/UI designer who needed a portfolio that could grow and evolve with their work. Since their ideas and content are always shifting,
I focused on flexibility: Astroâ€™s content-first architecture makes changes easy and fast. The result is a clean, modular site that functions like a living design
journal. Quick to load, simple to maintain, built to adapt.
