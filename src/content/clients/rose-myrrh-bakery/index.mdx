Rose & Myrrh is a brand-forward cafÃ© and bakery website built with Astro and Tailwind CSS. It was designed to feel
both grounded and enchanting, balancing earthy textures with poetic language to evoke a sense of ritual, warmth, and
place. The site features intuitive navigation, custom copywriting, and a flexible layout that invites storytelling
along with visual appeal. From handcrafted pastries to small delivery details, every element is meant to reflect the
care behind the food itself.
