Rose + Myrrh is a brand-forward cafÃ© and bakery website built with Astro. I designed it to feel both grounded and
enchantingâ€”balancing earthy textures with poetic language to evoke a sense of ritual, warmth, and place. The site
features intuitive navigation, custom copywriting, and a flexible layout that invites storytelling alongside visual
appeal. From handcrafted pastries to small delivery details, every element is meant to reflect the care behind the
food itself.
