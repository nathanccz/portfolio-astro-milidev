Crafted with precision and built on Next.js, Bourbon Society is a sleek, high-end restaurant website
that captures the rich, warm vibe of a late-night whiskey lounge. It features swift navigation, bold visuals,
and a stylish dark color scheme. It invites guests to explore bourbon culture—whether they’re booking a table, exploring
the menu, or just browsing the site. Every detail, from the woodgrain textures to the golden hues of the
hero image, sets the tone for an upscale experience that feels just as good online as it does in real life.
