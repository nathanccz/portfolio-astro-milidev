I built FreelanceFlow to help new developers who are great at coding but struggle with the business side of freelancing. Working at my agency, I saw firsthand how talented engineers would get stuck on things like finding clients, writing proposals, and managing projects.

Using React, Vite, and Appwrite, I created this tool that's part project tracker, part knowledge hub. It gives developers all the templates, guides, and tips they need to navigate freelancing confidently. Think of it as a "friendly guide" that walks you through everything from client meetings to sending invoices. The best part? It's open-source, so the whole community can improve it together as we learn what works best.
