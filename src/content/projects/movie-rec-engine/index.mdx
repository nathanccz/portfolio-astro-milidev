Wish someone actually understood your movie taste? This full-stack web app integrates OpenAIâ€™s API (the same tech behind ChatGPT) to chat with you and deliver personalized recommendations. Unlike traditional algorithms, this app learns through conversation and your real-time feedback. As you rate, favorite, and review films and TV shows, it quietly builds a profile of your tastes and preferred streaming platformsâ€”helping you get smarter suggestions, from trending blockbusters to hidden gems.
